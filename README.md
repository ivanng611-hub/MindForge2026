# MindForge
PRIVACY POLICY
==============

Last updated: May 15, 2026

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

MindForge ("the Application", "we", "us", or "our") is an offline mind mapping and brainstorming application. This Privacy Policy outlines how the Application handles user data.

2. DATA COLLECTION
------------------

The Application does NOT collect, transmit, or share any personal data. The Application is designed to function entirely offline without any internet connection.

Specifically, the Application does not:

  - Collect personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
  - Track user location
  - Monitor user behavior or usage patterns
  - Send analytics or crash reports to any third party
  - Display advertisements
  - Contain social media integrations
  - Communicate with any remote servers or APIs

3. DATA STORAGE
---------------

All data created by the user within the Application (mind maps, brainstorming cards, application settings) is stored exclusively on the user's device using the following local storage mechanisms:

  - IndexedDB (via Dexie.js): Stores mind map data and brainstorming board content.
  - localStorage: Stores application preferences (theme selection, language preference, encryption settings).

This data never leaves the user's device. No cloud backup, synchronization, or remote storage is used.

4. ENCRYPTION
-------------

The Application provides an optional local encryption feature. If enabled, user data is encrypted using AES-GCM 256-bit with a key derived from the user's passphrase via PBKDF2 with 600,000 iterations. The encryption key exists only in the device's memory during the active session and is never stored or transmitted.

This encryption is entirely optional and controlled by the user. Disabling encryption will store data in plain text locally on the device.

5. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
-----------------------

The Application uses the following third-party libraries that operate entirely locally and do not transmit data:

  - Angular / Ionic Framework: Application framework (local only)
  - Dexie.js: IndexedDB wrapper (local only)
  - ngx-translate: Localization library (local only)
  - UUID: Unique ID generation (local only)

None of these libraries transmit any data to external servers.

6. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
---------------------

The Application does not collect any personal information from any user, including children under the age of 13. Since all data is stored locally and no data is transmitted, there is no risk of children's data being collected or shared.

7. DATA DELETION
----------------

Users can delete all application data at any time by:

  - Deleting individual mind maps or boards within the Application
  - Clearing the app data through the device's system settings
  - Uninstalling the Application, which removes all locally stored data

8. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
-------------------------

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this document.

9. CONTACT
----------

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer at the email address listed on the Google Play Store listing for this Application.

10. DISCLAIMER
--------------

This Application is provided "as is" without any warranty. The developer takes no responsibility for any data loss or damage resulting from the use of this Application.
